## 🐛 Troubleshooting

If the deployment doesn't work:

1. **Check GitHub Pages is enabled**
   - Settings → Pages → Source should be "GitHub Actions"

2. **Check Actions tab**
   - Look for any failed workflow runs
   - Click on a run to see detailed logs

3. **Wait a few minutes**
   - First deployment can take 2-5 minutes
   - Subsequent deploys are faster

4. **Clear browser cache**
   - If you don't see updates, try hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)

5. **Check repository visibility**
   - Public repositories get free GitHub Pages
   - Private repositories need GitHub Pro
